PyThea is an open-source software package that can be used to reconstruct the 3D structure of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and shock waves and determine their kinematics using remote-sensing observations. The tool implements the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model that can be used to reconstruct CMEs and two geometrical models, namely a spheroid and ellipsoid model to reconstruct shock waves. It also implements remote-sensing observations from multiple viewpoints such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO).

Installing and Running PyThea
=============================

To install and run PyThea, Python >=3.8 or later is required. We recommend creating a virtual environment using conda and installing PyThea with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create the virtual environment
  conda create --name PyThea python=3.9

  # Activate the environment
  conda activate PyThea

  # Install the required packages using pip
  pip install PyThea

   # Run PyThea as Streamlit App.
  PyThea streamlit

You can find more information in :ref:`installing-pythea` and :ref:`runnig-pythea` sections.

The mythology of Thea
=====================

In Greek mythology, Thea, also called Euryphaessa "wide-shining", is the Titaness of sight and the shining light of the clear blue sky. Her brother/consort is Hyperion, a Titan and god of the sun, and together they are the parents of Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon), and Eos (the Dawn).
