_PyThea_ is an open-source software package that can be used to reconstruct the 3D structure of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and shock waves and determine their kinematics using remote-sensing observations. The tool implements the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model that can be used to reconstruct CMEs and two geometrical models, namely a spheroid and ellipsoid model to reconstruct shock waves. It also implements remote-sensing observations from multiple viewpoints such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). An online preview of this tool is available at [https://athkouloumvakos.github.io/PyThea](https://athkouloumvakos.github.io/PyThea).

## üíæ Installation

_PyThea_ is written in Python >=3.8 and has some package requirements, which are listed in the requirements.txt and environment.yml files.
To run localy this application we recomend to create its own virtual enviroment in Python.

**Recomended (conda)**

Because of a range of dependencies that packages have, the simplest way to work with _PyThea_
is in conda and to create its own environment using the ```conda env create```.
If you already have conda installed, then ```cd``` the root directory of _PyThea_ and in your terminal do:

```python
# Create a virtual environment in python using conda
#  see https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda info --envs

# Activate the enviroment
conda activate pythea

# When you are done you can deactivate a virtual environment
conda deactivate
```

**Alternative (pip)**

```python
# You can create a virtual environment in Python inside the project folder.
#  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the enviroment
source env/bin/activate

# install the required packages using pip3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# When you are done you can deactivate a virtual environment
deactivate
```

Now you can run any part of the _PyThea_ (see Usage section).

You may also add your _PyThea_ directory to the environment variable ```PYTHONPATH```. This is usefull if you need to run _PyThea_ tests or when you need to run some of the package modules out of streamlit.

In the terminal use the following and change the \<PyTheaRootDir\> with your path.

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<PyTheaRootDir>/PyThea"
```

For a premanent solution, if you're using bash (on a Mac or GNU/Linux distribution), add the above line to your ```~/.bashrc``` file (changing the \<PyTheaRootDir\> with your path first).

## üêæ Run localy the _PyThea_ application
Install the required Python packages, activate the enviroment as shown above, and then run the application with streamlit.
```
# cd into the package directory and run,
streamlit run PyThea_app.py
```
The application should now open in the default browser!

## üìô Usage

Complete documentation of the _PyThea_ can be found in (under construction)

## üì¶ Usefull Python packages

- [SunPy](https://sunpy.org/): The community-developed, free and open-source solar data analysis environment for Python.
- [AstroPy](https://www.astropy.org/): The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python.

## üìú Acknowledging or Citing PyThea [![https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5713659](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5713659.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5713659)

If you use _PyThea_ for scientific work or research presented in a publication, please cite this package by including in the methods or acknowledgement section the following: "This research has made use of PyThea v?.?.?, an open-source and free Python package to reconstruct the 3D structure of CMEs and shock waves (cite software).". For the _PyThea_ software citation use the following: "Athanasios Kouloumvakos. (2021). PyThea: A software package to reconstruct the 3D structure of CMEs and shock waves. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5713659](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5713659)". _PyThea_ has a strong dependency to SunPy and AstroPy Python packages, consider citing these packages as well. To acknowledge _PyThea_ in posters or talks include the project [logo](https://github.com/AthKouloumvakos/PyThea/blob/master/docs/logo/pythea_logo.png) or [icon](https://github.com/AthKouloumvakos/PyThea/blob/master/docs/logo/pythea_icon.png).

## ‚ìò The mythology of Thea:

In Greek mythology, Thea, also called Euryphaessa "wide-shining", is the Titaness of sight and the shining light of the clear blue sky. Her brother/consort is Hyperion, a Titan and god of the sun, and together they are the parents of Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon), and Eos (the Dawn).
